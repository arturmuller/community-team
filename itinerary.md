#Oh, the places we'll go!

##Where in the world should we visit next? 

We absolutely love to travel, because it allows us to meet our fellow community members IN REAL LIFE!

San Francisco is our home town, but we also have remote team members in Austin, Chicago, Seattle, Greenville, SC, and undoubtedly more places in the future. So, if we're already in _your_ hometown, let's hang out! 

For those of you with whom we don't share a home town, we'd love to pay you a visit some time.

####Want us to come to your town and say hi? Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), and we'll see about adding it to our itinerary! 

We can't make any promises, but we figured it'd be great to get input from our community members, so we can make more informed decisions in terms of where to focus our airline miles ðŸ›© 

This idea was inspired by tweets from community members like [Melanie](https://twitter.com/melaniersumner/status/657260447545098240) and [Michael](https://twitter.com/mike_mitt/status/657043522802044928), and we want to encourage more people to reach out like this. 

####How can we help? 
When we visit a [geographic] community, we tend to engage in lots of ways. Whatever we do, we aim for our efforts to create value for the people who are welcoming us into their "home."

#####Some examples
* Office Hours: we can get together, in 1-on-1 or small group setting, in an office, coffee shop, bar (anywhere!), and chat about data, analytics, community, startups, cat shirts (anything!). Our objective is to HELP. Whenever one of our team members is traveling to another city, we try to reach out to our local network and offer our time to be helpful. Likewise, we love it when folks reach out to us! 

* Workshops/Learning Labs:
  * Intro to Analytics & Event Data: we can host and instruct a workshop, providing a primer on data anayltics for entrepreneur, business leaders, and/or curious minds ([example](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/intro-to-analytics-event-data-at-keen-hq-tickets-19151742377))
  * Effective Communication (non-violent communication, etc)
  * Emotional Intelligence (cognitive reframing, emotional regulating, etc)

* Meetups
  * Happy Data Hour: we can help organize, promote, buy some dranks, and hang out with all y'all! 

* Talks
  * Our team members are knowledgeable in lots of topics - from technical to not-so-technical, from Keen IO/data-related stuff, to subject matters completely irrelevant to our business. 
    * Startup communities
    * Startup fundraising
    * Company culture
    *
